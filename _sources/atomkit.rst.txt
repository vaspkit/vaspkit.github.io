ATOMKIT Code
============

The VASPKIT team is actively developing an innovative and practical
software tool called ATOMKIT. Our long-term goal is to transform ATOMKIT
into a powerful and versatile crystal structure modeling software
toolkit that can run across different platforms to meet various research
needs. ATOMKIT integrates crystal structure manipulation, modeling,
format conversion, and visualization capabilities, while also providing
support for exporting various common material simulation software
structure file formats. The compiled version of the program can be obtained
from the `latest release page <https://sourceforge.net/projects/atomkit/files/Binaries/>`_ on sourceforge. ATOMKIT and
its sister software VASPKIT have very similar usage methods, allowing
for seamless switching between them.

ATOMKIT software aims to provide researchers and engineers with a
comprehensive tool for convenient handling of crystal structure data and
performing various simulations and analyses. Here are the key features
of ATOMKIT software:

-  **Crystal structure manipulation**: ATOMKIT software offers a
   powerful set of tools for manipulating crystal structures. Users can
   perform operations such as rotation, translation, scaling to adjust
   or edit the crystal structure as needed.

-  **Modeling capabilities**: ATOMKIT includes a range of modeling tools
   to assist users in creating crystal structures. Users can quickly
   generate crystal structures using input data such as atomic
   coordinates and unit cell parameters, and further edit and modify
   them as required.

-  **Format conversion**: ATOMKIT software supports the conversion of
   structure file formats required by various common material simulation
   software. Whether it is converting from one software format to
   another or transforming experimental data into a format acceptable by
   simulation software, ATOMKIT provides convenient functionality.

-  **Visualization**: ATOMKIT offers powerful visualization capabilities
   that allow users to intuitively observe and analyze crystal
   structures. Users can customize display styles, add labels, draw unit
   cells, and more to better understand the crystal structure and its
   characteristics (furture feature).

By integrating these features, ATOMKIT software aims to provide a
comprehensive and user-friendly tool to meet the needs of researchers
and engineers in crystal structure processing and material simulation.
Whether it is material design, performance prediction, or analysis of
experimental data, ATOMKIT will serve as a powerful assistant tool.
