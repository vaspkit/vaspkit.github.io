Download
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Currently we only provide the executable binary files of VASPKIT which can run on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. After downloading the package, please take a few minutes to read the instructions in the manual; everything is detailed there.

The compiled version of the program can be obtained from the `latest release page <https://sourceforge.net/projects/vaspkit/files/Binaries/>`_ on sourceforge. At the release page you find the a compressed tarball (tar zxvf vaspkit.*.tar.gz) usually containing the following content:

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
VASPKIT is supported by Python 3.x. Please install the following dependencies prior to installing VASPKIT. I strongly suggest to use `anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`_ package to manage various python packages.

* `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ 3.5 or higher
* `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ 1.15.4 or higher
* `Scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_ 1.1.0 or higher
* `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ 3.0.1 or higher

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

(1) First unzip VASPKIT package.

::

   tar -zxvf vaspkit.1.00.tar.gz  

In order to ensure the full functionality of VASPKIT, please configure
the environment of the vaspkit from ``~/.vaspkit`` file. Enter VASPKIT
folder, and copy the environment variable file
``how_to_set_environment_variable`` to users’ home directory by running
the following command under the bash terminal.

::

   cd vaspkit.1.00
   cp -f how_to_set_environment_variable ~/.vaspkit

Edit the ``.vaspkit`` file,

::

   vi ~/.vaspkit

The configuration ``~/.vaspkit`` file is mainly used to set the environment variables
of VASPKIT, including VASP version information, directory of the target
pseudo potential, selection of functional, whether to use recommended
POTCAR, and so on. 

Usually, the ``PBE_PATH`` is the only one that need to be modified
according to your POTCAR path.

(2) Setting up local repository pseudo potential directory. For example,
    unzip the VASP PAW_PBE pseudo potentials at ``~/POTCAR/PBE``
    directory.

(3) Add the absolute path of the vaspkit to the environment variable.
(4) The ``~/.vaspkit`` file might need to be manually updated if some new environment variables are introduced in the newest version of vaspkit.

::

   echo 'export PATH=/home/vaspkit.1.00/bin/:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc

Replace the absolute path of the ``/home/vaspkit.1.00/bin/`` directory
by user’s own VASPKIT executable path.

VASPKIT provides an automatic configuration script ``setup.sh`` since
version 0.73. Execute

​ ``source setup.sh`` or ``bash setup.sh`` and finally, ``source ~/.bashrc``

Installation FAQs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. If ``~/.vaspkit`` already exists, the above operation will not be
overwritten. The old version of the environment variable file will be
kept.

After above settings, you can start the VASPKIT by directly typing
``vaspkit`` in the terminal. 


2. If the following problem occurs, your LINUX dependent library version is
too low and needs to be upgraded (not recommended), you can contact the
developer to get the version compiled in the low version LINUX
environment.

::

   vaspkit: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by vaspkit)

3. If the\ ``-bash: line 7: ./vaspkit: Permission denied permission`` issue
occurs, simply add the VASPKIT execute permission:

::

   chmod u+x /home/vaspkit.1.00/bin/vaspkit

4. Some show graph functions rely on python environment with matplotlib. To
invoke those functions, users should set the default python version and
``PLOT_MATPLOTLIB`` in ``~/.vaspkit``

::

   PYTHON_BIN                ~/anaconda3/bin/python3 
   PLOT_MATPLOTLIB          .TURE. 

5. The Windows version of vaspkit is still maturing. A few utilities fail to run under Windows system, for example, cannot read the configuration .vaspkit file and generate POTCAR file.
